##### This is the repository that I keep my studies on fault tolerant electrical drives.

### Short-term goals
1 - Quick scan of the following theses
- ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF HIGH PERFORMANCE MULTIPHASE ELECTRIC DRIVES FOR VEHICLE AND AIRCRAFT APPLICATIONS.
- Dynamic drive concept using speed dependent power electronics reconfiguration.

2 - Readings on machine design and electrical drive&control. Following books will be examined.
- Intorduction to AC Machine Design. Fortino, Giancarlo Goldgof, Dmitry Heirman, Don Hosain, Ekram
- Electrical Machine Drives Control: An Introduction. Pyrhöonen, Juha Hrabovcová, Valéria R Semken, Scott **(First 3 chapters are examined)**

3 - Dealing with sprints **in progress**

### Long-term goals

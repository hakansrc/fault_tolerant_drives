##### This is the repository that I keep my studies on fault tolerant electrical drives.

### Short-term goals
1 - Examining the following theses and their references related to fault tolerance. **(This may take a while).**
- Design of Multilevel Integrated Modular Motor Drive with Gallium Nitride Power Devices. **(Thesis examined. References awaiting. )**
- Design and Analysis of Fractional-Slot Concentrated-Winding Multiphase Fault-Tolerant Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines.**(Thesis examined. References awaiting.)**
- Space Vector Modulation applied to a split phase winding of a PMSM. **(In progress)**

2 - Readings on machine design and electrical drive&control. Following books will be examined.
- Intorduction to AC Machine Design. Fortino, Giancarlo Goldgof, Dmitry Heirman, Don Hosain, Ekram
- Electrical Machine Drives Control: An Introduction. Pyrhöonen, Juha Hrabovcová, Valéria R Semken, Scott

3 - Dealing with sprints **in progress**
